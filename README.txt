I implemented the structure of a hangman in c++. It's really an inefficient code, but it works. It also gave me the opportunity to mess around with libcurl for a bit. 
It just calls an API that generates a random word in English(sometimes some obscure ones i may say), and uses it as the main word that you need to figure out in the game.
