I implemented the structure of a hangman in C. The code is really inefficient, but it works. It also gave me the opportunity to experiment with libcurl for a bit. 
It just calls an API that generates a random word in English(sometimes an obscure one, i may say), and uses it as the main word that you need to figure out in the game.
